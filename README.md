<h1 style="text-align: center;">CrapMap - Get rid of your crap!</h1>

Stack: React (create-react-app), Redux, Firebase, Node.js

## Who

    We are team Deep C Fivers! We wrote this React Application as our capstone project for the Techtonic Academy.

## What

    Crapmap is a web application that streamlines the process of listing and getting rid of unwanted items. 
    All users have to do is sign in with their facebook/google account (or an email address) snap a pic of their stuff on the side of their street, and hope somebody comes and picks it up.
    Crapmap aims to rebrand the current perception of 'free listings' on the internet. Everybody has stuff they want to get rid of, Crapmap just makes it simple and fun!

    Crapmap was built in React, bootstrapped with Facebooks Create-React-App. The state and data is managed in the application by Redux, and the back-end is built in Firebase, utilizing REST endpoints deployed to Firebase.
